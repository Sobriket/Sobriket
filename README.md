This game has been made for the CreaJam 2024 on Unity. 
The theme was "Deeper and Deeper" with an optional constraint "Black & White".

It's an endless runner in first person view, you're playing in a bicolor environment where you have to dodge donuts, crystals, fans and brick walls. 
Your goal is to go the furthest possible.
