## >> Rogue Like Project <<

> Try the game [here](https://sobriket.itch.io/rogue-like-test)

This is a rogue like test/prototype and the first project I did on Unity.

In this game I had to do the map generation. 
I started by doing the main path(from the start to the end) and then I randomly put rooms next to this path until i have no more rooms to place.
I also did every room types. The goal was to have a lot of enemies room(we stopped at one), a shop, a loot room, a secret room(foundable with a key), empty room and a room where you can use golds to have bonus stats in the level.

## >> Rodent <<

> Try the game [here](https://sobriket.itch.io/rodent)

You lived your whole life as a rat lab. But now, this is over ! With the help of Volt, the small rodent, you will escape and have your revenge.
The little mouse will finally bite...

In this game I had to do 2D physics such as basic OBB AABB collisions and 2D raycasts.
I also did basic AI for the enemies. They roam from a point to another,detect you if you are in sight and then chase the player.
And finally I did the Boss of the game(Gonk). 
He has two types of attack :
- First he can smash the ground to summon spikes from the ground.
- Second he tries to hit the player with a giant red beam.

He has a shield bar and a life bar. When you manage to reduce his shield to zero he puts a knee to the ground so the player can hit him from the back.
